    </div>
    <div class="descabout">
      <h5 class="descaboutText">In the early years, the 20th century, Lee Giano founded his carpentry in Acciano, Italy. Lee Giano's carpentry quickly became known for its high-quality, handcrafted furniture. Lee Giano himself was a highly skilled craftsman, and his furniture was prized for its beauty and durability.<br><br>
        In the years following World War II, Lee Giano's carpentry began to experience financial difficulties. The Italian economy was in recession, and Lee Giano's customers were increasingly unable to afford his luxury furniture. In order to keep his business afloat, Lee Giano began to produce instruments and more affordable furniture.<br><br>
        The first instruments produced by Lee Giano's carpentry were violins and Pianos. These instruments quickly became popular, and Lee Giano's carpentry soon began to produce a wide variety of musical instruments. Today, the company is one of the world's leading producers of musical instruments, and its products, are prized for their quality and craftsmanship.<br><br>
        After Lee Giano's Death in 1999 Grandson Allesio Giano took over his company and decided that a new era has come. He expanded the companies' product line and updated the marketing strategy.
        When the 21st Century came around, he decided to step down as the owner of Leeano and give the company to his Son, Roberto Giano.<br><br>
        His Son, noticing the boom of technology, decided that they should begin the process of programming a software that can be used for tuning the various instruments, Leeano produced over the years. Leeano although had little to no knowledge in technology and programming, so they decided to create a new division that is stationed in Bern, Switzerland, that would be responsible for creating the new Software.<br><br>
        However the head of the newly formed software division, showed inadequate executive experience, so Roberto Giano decided to relieve the head of the software division from his position and appointed two of his coworkers as temporary CEO and Managing Partner for the software division.<br><br>
        This crucial decision proved, to be the right one, because after approximately one year the first alpha version of the Leeano Suono software was released for testing. The newly finished software although it was still in its testing phase managed to pull some impossible feats. Altough it would be several years before the Software would be released to the public.
        After the successful launch of the Software in spring of 2022, Roberto Giano decided to step down from his position as Owner, and give it to his son Leone Giano.<br><br>
        As of August 2022, Leeano sports over 2500 employees across 16 Countries. With 3 Division in each affiliated location, Leeano aught to be one of the biggest instrument and software producers in the world.</h5>
