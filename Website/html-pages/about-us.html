    <h3>History</h3>
    <p class=class="uk-container">In the early years of the 20th century, Lee Giano founded his carpentry in Acciano,
      Italy .
      Lee Giano's carpentry quickly became known for its high-quality, handcrafted furniture. Lee Giano himself was a
      highly skilled craftsman, and his furniture was prized for its beauty and durability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the years following World War II, Lee Giano's carpentry began to experience financial difficulties. The Italian
      economy was in recession, and Lee Giano's customers were increasingly unable to afford his luxury furniture. In
      order to keep his business afloat, Lee Giano began to produce instruments and more affordable furniture. The first
      instruments produced by Lee Giano's carpentry were violins and Pianos.
    </p>
    <p>
      These instruments quickly became popular, and Lee Giano's carpentry soon began to produce a wide variety of
      musical instruments. Today, the company is one of the world's leading producers of musical instruments, and its
      products are prized for their quality and craftsmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of Lee Giano's carpentry is a remarkable tale of success in the face of adversity. Despite economic
      hardships,
      Lee Giano was able to keep his business afloat by adapting to changing market conditions. Today, his legacy
      continues on
      through his company's commitment to quality and craftsmanship. </p>
